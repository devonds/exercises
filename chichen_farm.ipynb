They could compare the distributions of feather color, favorite songs, etc from those farms with our distributions, and use a simple statistical test (like Chi-Square) to calculate a probability that the difference between our distibution and the broader distribution is due to chance.  At a very low probabilty, they might ask questions about our data. \n",

This is an example of how I would go back to the person requesting the data and ask, are you sure you want these tags to have incubation location for all parents and grandparents? What format would work for you? How do you imagine using it? It's not hard to do, but would require joining each grandparents table to the eggs table, and I'd want to varify that I understand the need.  In the process, I might find that the data user needs something different -- the number of eggs laid to date, the feather color of parents, etc. \n",
